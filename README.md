  Peruse through my portfolio! Read up a bit about me, then make your way through the tabs to see some of my works. You can click on the links and they will take you to either the deployed application or the github repo. On the next tab, you can download my resume or just read a short summary of the various languages and technologies that I am proficient with. If you're interested, you can send me a message in the next tab. If you'd like to find me in other places, follow the links down in the header.
